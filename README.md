## Migration

`ibm-platform-services` package has been deprecated! 
The Platform Services Node SDK is now available as `@ibm-cloud/platform-services`.

To migrate to the new package, you can use the commands listed below:

```
npm uninstall ibm-platform-services
npm install @ibm-cloud/platform-services
```

You will also need to modify any references to the old package `ibm-platform-services` within import/require statements so they reflect the new package `@ibm-cloud/platform-services`.  Here is an example:

```javascript

// A 'require' statement that reflects the old package name:
const UserManagementV1 = require('ibm-platform-services/user-management/v1');

// Modify this to reflect the new package name:
const UserManagementV1 = require('@ibm-cloud/platform-services/user-management/v1');

```
